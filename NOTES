CODING

Be consistent in use of implicit arguments, notations, import vs export


PROJECT

We compile with "-R . ITR" where ITR stands for Infinitary Term Rewriting. A
better name for the namespace of our code might be possible. A good name for
the entire project would be even better.

Use coqdoc.

Reintroduce install-doc, dist, and install-dist from the CoLoR Makefile.
